# Phone-Price-Console-App
Easy C# OOP Console Project

Here is a simple C# console application for practicing object-oriented programming (OOP). When the user enters option 1, the previously entered personal information will be displayed on the screen. When the user enters option 2, the previously entered phone information will be displayed. When the user enters option 3, the program will prompt the user to enter their balance. If the balance is sufficient, a message will be displayed. Otherwise, a different message will be displayed.
